# USART-initialisation-in_AVR-C

This is my effort of implementing printf and other similar functions (look in USART.h) in bare metal AVR C.

### Note : The above code only works for these ATmega48A-PA-88A-PA-168A-PA-328-P microcontrollers. However, my code can be tweaked for other AVR micrcontrollers, just check the datasheet.
